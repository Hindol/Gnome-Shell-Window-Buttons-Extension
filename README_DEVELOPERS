There are three branches:
* master
* gnome3.2
* gnome3.4

The gnome3.2 and gnome3.4 branches are where the code for these respective versions of the extension live. They are quite different (for example GNOME 3.4 version can use gnome-shell-extension-prefs, whereas GNOME 3.2 you're stuck with editing the extensin.js file).

The master branch is sort of in limbo at the moment (don't know what to do with it).
For now it mirrors upstream/master which is a GNOME 3.4 version of the extension.

If you make any changes to metadata files for the extension that you want to port to both other branches, do it in the master branch. For example: metadata.json, README.md, Makefile. Then merge these changes from master to gnome3.2 and gnome3.4.

Note - the way I (m.c) am playing it at the moment is as follows: mathematicalcoffee fork of this extension is where development happens, and it all then gets pushed to the biox repository.


TODO

* add more options for which buttons to add?
